# Reflect

Mine the current conversation for durable learnings, then route them into skill edits.

## When to invoke

- The user said "reflect" or "/reflect".
- A complex task (5+ tool calls) just landed cleanly and the recipe is worth keeping.
- The agent hit dead ends, found the working path, and the path generalizes.
- The user corrected the agent's approach mid-task.
- A non-trivial workflow emerged that isn't captured anywhere.

Skip when the conversation is trivial, off-topic, or already covered by an existing skill the parent followed correctly. One-offs are not learnings.

## Process

### 1. Locate the active transcript

The parent finds this conversation's DSH session log before fanning out. JSONL backends expose a path through `SessionPersistence.locate`; SQLite backends share one database and have no per-session file (`docs/subsystems/persistence.md`). Use the current session and, if present, session-query tools. Do not glob `~/.cursor/projects/*/`. Do not glob other users' `$DSH_HOME`.

If no on-disk transcript path resolves, write a tight digest of this session and pass that instead.

### 2. Spawn three reviewers in parallel

One message, three `pstack_spawn` calls. Roles: `reflect-judgment`, `reflect-tooling`, `reflect-judgment` again for the divergent lens (`route_index` 0 unless overlay listed extra routes). `run_in_background: true`. Do not send `model` or `readonly`. Overlay or inherit. Reviewers need the same tools as the parent for context lookups; the prompt forbids file writes; the parent applies edits. Follow [`../setup-pstack/references/spawn.md`](../setup-pstack/references/spawn.md).

| Lens | `role` | Prompt template |
|---|---|---|
| Judgment | `reflect-judgment` | `references/judgment-reviewer.md` |
| Tooling | `reflect-tooling` | `references/tooling-reviewer.md` |
| Divergent | `reflect-judgment` | `references/divergent-reviewer.md` |

Pass each template verbatim, substituting the transcript path or digest where marked. Reviewers return findings in the spawn result or settlement notice.

### 3. Synthesize

One `pstack_spawn`, `role: reflect-judgment`. Do not send `model` or `readonly`. Overlay or inherit. Use `references/synthesizer.md` verbatim, with each reviewer's full output inlined where marked. The synthesizer returns a structured Accepted / Rejected / Backlog list.

### 4. Structural enforcement check

Sanity-check the synthesizer's Accepted list. For any item that would be enforced more reliably by a lint rule, script, metadata flag, or runtime check, move it from Accepted to Backlog. The synthesizer already applies this criterion; this is a final pass before edits land. See the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill.

### 5. Apply

Before applying any Accepted edit, present the synthesizer's full Accepted/Rejected/Backlog output to the user and wait for explicit approval. The user picks which subset to apply and may redirect routings. Skill changes affect every future agent in the org; do not auto-apply.

Backlog items file to whatever devex / backlog tracker your team uses automatically. Those are tracker submissions, not skill edits. Only the Accepted list waits for approval.

For each approved Accepted item, follow the Routing field exactly:

- Trivial existing-skill edit (a one-line bullet, a tightened sentence, a stale fact corrected): parent does directly.
- Substantive existing-skill edit (a new section, a new pattern table, more than ~10 lines): hand to the **authoring-a-skill** playbook skill and run its draft / test / iterate loop.
- `tune description: <skill path>` (the skill exists but didn't trigger when it should have): tighten `description` and kebab-case `name` per DSH skill-filesystem rules.
- `new skill via authoring-a-skill: <kebab-name>`: hand creation to the **authoring-a-skill** playbook. Do not invent the shape ad hoc.

If your environment ships a SKILL.md validator, run it on every touched skill before declaring done. Skip this step if it doesn't.

### 6. Summarize for the user

Short list, no preamble:

- Edits applied: `<skill path>`. What changed, one line each.
- New skills created: `<skill path>`. One line each (rare).
- Backlog filed to the devex tracker: `<issue title>` (`<tags>`). One line each.
- Dropped: one line per rejected finding + reason from the synthesizer.
