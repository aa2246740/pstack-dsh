### Bug fix

**You own this task. Plan, review, verify.** Delegate investigation and the fix to subagents, stay in the lead.

Be scientific. Every shipped line traces to runtime evidence. Code that "might help" is a hypothesis, not a fix. It does not ship. When evidence refutes a hypothesis, revert what it motivated. Ship the smallest change the evidence justifies.

1. Reproduce it yourself on the matching surface via the control skill. Don't hand the repro to the user. A debug or instrumentation protocol that says to ask the user does not override this. You drive the instrumented runtime. Ask the user only with a specific reason the control tool cannot reach the target, and only after driving it as far as it goes. If it won't reproduce directly, synthesize the trigger, tighten conditions, or instrument until it fires.
2. Binary-search the cause. Form candidate hypotheses, then rule them out until one survives. Seed them with `how` over the affected subsystem and the **why** skill for regression history. Each pass, take the split that cuts the most remaining problem space, get runtime evidence, eliminate. When program state is unclear, add instrumentation or logging and read it as the code runs. Don't guess. For a long hunt, use the goal-based continued execution in `playbooks/autonomous-run.md`. Confirm the surviving mechanism with runtime evidence before the step-3 architect/interrogate fan-out.
3. Plan the fix. If it crosses a function boundary, `architect` first. Delegate implementation with `pstack_spawn` `role: bug-fix` and a specific scope. Routing uses the overlay or inherits the parent. Review the diff.
4. Verify on the same surface. The original repro now passes. "Inconclusive" or wrong-surface is not a pass. Flag it. Unit tests show branch behavior, not bug absence.
5. Stage the commits so the failing repro lands before the fix in git history. See the **tdd** skill for the failing-test-first cadence when the bug has a cheap local test path. Skip it when the test would be expensive, integration-heavy, or unclear.
   This is the canonical **sequence-verifiable-units** principle skill, the failing test first and the fix on top.
6. Run **Opening a PR**.

Investigation fans out `how` + `why` as parallel subagents.

**Reply:** what was broken, root cause, fix, how you verified. Paste failing-then-passing repro output verbatim.
