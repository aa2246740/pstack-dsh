### Worktree and simulator cleanup

**You own the disk and the safety gate.** Prune merged or abandoned git worktrees and stale iOS simulators to reclaim space. Guard against deleting anything in use or holding uncommitted work.

1. Snapshot and audit. Record `df -h /` and inspect `scripts/worktree-audit.sh` before running it per **principle-build-the-lever**. It currently assumes `origin/main`, `gh`, and Cursor transcript paths. Run it only when those assumptions match the authorized repository and transcript scope. Otherwise audit with `git worktree list` and the resolved forge without scanning unrelated sessions. Classify worktrees by size, age, merge state, uncommitted work, PR state, and known session use. Background a slow authorized transcript scan. Missing session evidence means unknown usage, not safe to delete.
2. The bucket is advice, not permission. Get pinned and active sessions from the user or available UI and cross-check every candidate per **principle-prove-it-works**. The active set wins over a `safe` label.
3. Verify usage before deleting. For every `verify-recent-chat` row or doubtful candidate, delegate authorized transcript reads per **principle-guard-the-context-window**. Report whether a session is pinned or ongoing and which worktrees it touches. Include sibling arena and repro worktrees used by background subagents.
4. Pause on irreversible loss. `wip:N` means N tracked uncommitted edits. Show the diff and get a decision before deleting them. Inspect and name untracked files before classifying them as disposable scratch. Clean, merged, and not-in-use worktrees can proceed within the user's cleanup scope. Hold `wip`, unknown usage, and in-use trees.
5. Prune the confirmed set. Per path, use `git worktree remove <path>`. If ignored build artifacts prevent removal, inspect them and confirm they are disposable before using `--force`. Do not bypass a sandbox denial. Run `git worktree prune`, confirm with `df -h /`, and re-list. Preserve branch refs.
6. For simulator cleanup, inspect `xcrun simctl runtime list` and device usage first. Delete only confirmed unused testing clones, unavailable devices, or old runtimes within scope. Inspect Xcode `DerivedData`, `iOS DeviceSupport`, and package caches separately. Do not treat DSH session stores or another application's state as disposable cache.

These deletion gates replace the code review that would catch a mistake in a code change.

**Reply:** `df -h /` before and after with space reclaimed, worktrees pruned, and a one-line reason for each held back.
